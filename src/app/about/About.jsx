              A venture with a history of 20+ years began its instigation into
              the corporate world in 2000. A time when the UAE was still
              constructing its path toward a ubiquitous position in the economy.
              A time when our business took its first baby steps in the market.
              At the time, our focus encircled around electronics, hence the
              name “Al Katef Electronics and Equip.” sought a spot within the
              UAE market. TVs, computers, and ACs, slowly shifted to printers
              and photocopiers. Gaining popularity in the field, our vision
              pivoted towards the market that involved dealing with large
              suppliers of photocopiers in the country, which was by the year
              2005. Our services included AMC, rental, repair works, and sale of
              consumables and printers of a wide range of products and brands
              that earned us a fair share of trusted and satisfied clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              2013 was when we could identify ourselves as one of the leading
              retailers in the photocopier/ printer market, with inquiries and
              clients across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
              To add to our vision of merging with 21st-century advancements, we
              decided to expand our area of expertise to the IT domain.
              Confident that our satisfied customers will support us through our
              new venture, the plan was put into action in the year 2022,
              developing the name “Al Katef IT Solutions”{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2023, Al Katef IT Solutions, took a step towards opening a
              branch in India that began with recruiting a talented and a
              skilled team who’d bring our value and mission closer to success.{" "}
